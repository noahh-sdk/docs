**Noahh** is a [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) mod loader and modding SDK with a modern approach towards mod development. Unlike previous mod loaders, which merely inject the DLLs and let them handle the rest, Noahh aims to be a more comprehensive project, which manages loaded mods & hooks itself. Noahh utilizes a trap hooking technique for hooks to ensure performance, compatability, portability and ease of use. For modders, Noahh means easy development and portability; for end users, Noahh means an uniform and easy experience using mods.
