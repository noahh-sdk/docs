# What is Noah?

## In short, it is to GD what Forge / Fabric are to Minecraft.

Noahh is a **modding SDK** and **mod loader**. It contains a suite of tools that make developing mods fast and easy, and also has the actual loader for using those mods.

### For users,

Noahh makes installing and updating mods as simple as the click of a button. No need to drag any odd `.DLL` files and resources; just select in-game to install a mod, and that's it. Noahh also acts as a gateway for mods on different platforms; Noahh will be available on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and likely Android aswell.

### For modders,

Noahh lets you write simple yet refactorable and extensible code, and lets you write mods for multiple platforms from one codebase. It abstracts away unnecessary details while staying low-level, granting you a much easier programming experience without sacrificing customizability or performance. Noahh also comes with multiple systems in place to make sure your mod stays compatible with others; as long as you follow Noahh modding guidelines, your mod won't magically break when another is installed. Noahh also gives you a standardized platform to easily distribute and update your mods.

## FAQ

**Can I use normal DLLs with Noahh?**

No, Noahh can only load Noahh-specific mods. You can't use another modloader alongside Noahh either as that will likely cause incompatabilities and crashes. We will do our best to port as many mods as people want for Noahh though! :)

**What about mods like Mega Hack v7?**

Absolute is ready to port Mega Hack v7 to Noahh once Noahh is done, so no worry. We will ask other modders to port their mods aswell, or port them ourselves.

**When will Noahh be finished?**

We don't know. It's a project that is constantly evolving so we have no way of giving a meaningful ETA. A public alpha/beta will hopefully be out mid-May though!

**Will Noahh be free?**

Yes, Noahh will be 100% free for all users on all platforms. Some Noahh mods may cost money, but our current planned model incentivizes making free mods that are supported by donations :)
