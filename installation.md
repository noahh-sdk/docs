# Installing Noahh

## Using the installer

Noahh can be installed using the official [installer](https://github.com/noahh-sdk/installer/releases/latest). Just download the installer & run it to install the Noahh loader to GD. If you're interested in developing mods for Noahh, run the installer again as Administrator and install the Noahh dev tools. This will install the Noahh SDK on your computer & set up the required environment variables :)
